# The Next Dimension 3D
A 3D top-down bullet-hell shooter designed for desktop and gamepads built in my second year 2013 using C/C++, OpenGL/GLSL, FMOD and SFML. Demoed at the Level Up Showcase 2013 in Toronto. My work on the project included:
•	Programmed core framework
      •	Core math librairies (Vector, Matrix, Quaternion)
      •	OpenGL with GLSL shader framework
      •	Wrote FMOD wrapper
      •	Implemented SFML input and window handling
      •	Particle systems
•	Designed and programmed  NPC behaviours
      •	Flocking
      •	Boss fights
•	Designed and programmed particle effects 
•	Programmed GLSL shaders for bloom, levels, gamma, scrolling texture effect
